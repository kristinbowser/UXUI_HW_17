                <h1>Hello World! I'm Kristin Bowser.<br> 
                UX Researcher, Designer, and Human-Behavior Enthusiast.
                </h1>
                <p>I’m a User Experience Researcher leveraging a background in L&D and communication to 
                    build a career in UX. I recently earned a certificate in UX/UI from Georgia Institute 
                    of Technology to develop skills in design thinking, UX research, UI design, and HTML/CSS 
                    and JavaScript. <br> <br>
                    Known as an excellent communicator with a knack for understanding how to interact with people 
                    from many backgrounds, my passion for details allows me to have a particular affinity for UX 
                    research and writing. I’m looking forward to using my UX/UI skills and personal penchant for 
                    human behavior and communication to aid a team in both research and writing.
